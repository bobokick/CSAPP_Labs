Note: Updated to Y86-64 for CS:APP3e. Students are given a small default Y86-64 array copying function and a working pipelined Y86-64 processor design that runs the copy function in some nominal number of clock cycles per array element (CPE). The students attempt to minimize the CPE by modifying both the function and the processor design. This gives the students a deep appreciation for the interactions between hardware and software.
Note: The lab materials include the master source distribution of the Y86-64 processor simulators and the Y86-64 Guide to Simulators.
