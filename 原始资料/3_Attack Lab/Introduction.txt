Note: This is the 64-bit successor to the 32-bit Buffer Lab. Students are given a pair of unique custom-generated x86-64 binary executables, called targets, that have buffer overflow bugs. One target is vulnerable to code injection attacks. The other is vulnerable to return-oriented programming attacks. Students are asked to modify the behavior of the targets by developing exploits based on either code injection or return-oriented programming. This lab teaches the students about the stack discipline and teaches them about the danger of writing code that is vulnerable to buffer overflow attacks.
If you're a self-study student, here are a pair of Ubuntu 12.4 targets that you can try out for yourself. You'll need to run your targets using the "-q" option so that they don't try to contact a non-existent grading server. If you're an instructor with a CS:APP acount, you can download the solutions here.
