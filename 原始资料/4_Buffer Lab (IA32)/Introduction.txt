Note: This is the legacy 32-bit lab from CS:APP2e. It has been replaced by the Attack Lab. In the Buffer Lab, students modify the run-time behavior of a 32-bit x86 binary executable by exploiting a buffer overflow bug. This lab teaches the students about the stack discipline and teaches them about the danger of writing code that is vulnerable to buffer overflow attacks.
