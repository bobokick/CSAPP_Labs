A "binary bomb" is a program provided to students as an object code file. When run, it prompts the user to type in 6 different strings. If any of these is incorrect, the bomb "explodes," printing an error message and logging the event on a grading server. Students must "defuse" their own unique bomb by disassembling and reverse engineering the program to determine what the 6 strings should be. The lab teaches students to understand assembly language, and also forces them to learn how to use a debugger. It's also great fun. A legendary lab among the CMU undergrads.
Here's a Linux/x86-64 binary bomb that you can try out for yourself. The feature that notifies the grading server has been disabled, so feel free to explode this bomb with impunity. If you're an instructor with a CS:APP account, then you can download the solution.
